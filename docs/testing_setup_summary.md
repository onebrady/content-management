# Testing Setup Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the testing setup for the Content Development Flow project.

## Test Types

### Unit Tests (Jest + React Testing Library)

- Framework: Jest with React Testing Library
- Configuration: `jest.config.js` and `jest.setup.js`
- Coverage thresholds: 70% for lines/statements, 60% for branches/functions

### End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

- Framework: Playwright
- Configuration: `playwright.config.ts`
- Test directory: `e2e/`

## Current Test Coverage

### API Routes

- Search API (`/api/search`): 97.87% coverage
- Content API (`/api/content`): 78.04% coverage
- Tags API (`/api/tags`): 84% coverage
- Users API (`/api/users`): 100% coverage
- Notifications API (`/api/notifications`): 56.66% coverage

### Components

- Navigation/Breadcrumbs: 100% coverage
- UI/LoadingSpinner: 100% coverage
- Tables/DataTable: 50% coverage (needs fixes)
- Content/ContentForm: 34.21% coverage (needs fixes)
- Auth/PermissionGuard: 42.85% coverage

### Hooks

- useAuth: 100% coverage
- useAutoSave: 86.36% coverage
- useSearch: 96.66% coverage

### Utils

- test-utils: 100% coverage

### Library Functions

- analytics.ts: 42.85% coverage
- permissions.ts: 51.11% coverage
- prisma.ts: 83.33% coverage
- search.ts: 68.62% coverage

## Overall Coverage

- Statements: 11.15% (target: 70%)
- Branches: 9.17% (target: 60%)
- Functions: 7.86% (target: 60%)
- Lines: 11.14% (target: 70%)

## Known Issues

### API Tests

- Some API routes don't export POST functions correctly, making them difficult to test

### Component Tests

- ContentForm tests have issues with the editor mock
- DataTable tests have issues with pagination text matching

## Next Steps

1. Fix failing tests:
   - ContentForm component tests
   - DataTable component tests

2. Increase test coverage by adding tests for:
   - Remaining API routes
   - Core components (approval, comments, notifications)
   - Utility functions (email, versioning)
   - Hooks (useNotifications, useAnalytics)

3. Consider adjusting coverage thresholds temporarily to allow for incremental improvement

4. Ensure E2E tests run correctly with Playwright (separate from Jest)
