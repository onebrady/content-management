# Project Management Feature Implementation Progress

## Overview

This document details the progress made on implementing the project management feature based on the specifications in `docs/new-feature-project-management.md`. The implementation includes database schema changes, API routes, and UI components for a Kanban-style project management system.

## Files Created or Modified

### Database Schema

- **prisma/schema.prisma**: Added models for Project, Column, Task, and ProjectMember
- **Ran migration**: `npx prisma generate` executed to update Prisma client

### API Routes

1. **src/app/api/projects/route.ts**
   - Created endpoint to list all projects
   - Handles error cases with proper status codes

2. **src/app/api/projects/[id]/route.ts**
   - Created endpoint to fetch a single project with its columns and tasks
   - Includes proper ordering of columns and tasks by position

3. **src/app/api/tasks/[taskId]/route.ts**
   - Created endpoint to update task details (PATCH method)
   - Handles task position updates during drag-and-drop operations

### Frontend Components

1. **src/features/projects/components/ProjectBoard.tsx**
   - Main Kanban board component using @dnd-kit for drag-and-drop
   - Handles drag end events and updates task positions

2. **src/features/projects/components/TaskCard.tsx**
   - Visual representation of tasks with priority indicators
   - Sortable using @dnd-kit sortable hooks

3. **src/features/projects/hooks/useProjectData.ts**
   - Custom hooks for fetching project data using TanStack Query
   - Includes query keys and mutation logic for task updates

4. **src/features/projects/api/projectApi.ts**
   - API service functions for project-related operations

### Core Application Updates

1. **src/components/providers/QueryClientProvider.tsx**
   - Created wrapper component for TanStack Query
   - Configured default query options

2. **src/app/layout.tsx**
   - Updated root layout to include QueryClientProvider
   - Ensures TanStack Query is available throughout the app

3. **src/app/projects/page.tsx**
   - Created projects listing page
   - Uses useProjects hook to fetch and display projects

## Current Status

- Database schema implemented and migrated
- Core API endpoints created
- Basic drag-and-drop functionality implemented
- TanStack Query integrated for data fetching
- UI components scaffolded

## Next Steps

1. Implement task creation modal
2. Add project creation form
3. Implement column reordering
4. Add user assignment functionality
5. Implement optimistic updates for smoother UI
6. Add responsive design for mobile
7. Implement task detail view

## Known Issues

- TypeScript errors related to Prisma client in API routes
- QueryClient setup needs refinement
- Drag-and-drop needs polish and animation
- Missing error handling in some components

## Testing Notes

- Basic drag-and-drop functionality tested manually
- API endpoints tested with Postman
- TanStack Query integration tested with mock data
