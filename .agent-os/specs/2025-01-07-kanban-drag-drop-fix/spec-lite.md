# Spec Summary (Lite)

Fix the broken Kanban drag-and-drop functionality where project cards disappear, bounce, or appear in wrong positions when dragged between status columns. Implement proper @hello-pangea/dnd integration with native HTML elements, smooth visual feedback, and reliable state management to ensure cards follow the cursor smoothly and drop accurately in target columns.
