# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-06-trello-project-management/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Architecture

- **Drag and Drop System**: Implement using @dnd-kit/core and @dnd-kit/sortable for smooth card movement between columns with visual feedback and touch support
- **Real-time Updates**: Integrate WebSocket/Server-Sent Events using Next.js API routes for live board collaboration
- **State Management**: Use TanStack Query for server state and Zustand for local UI state management of board interactions
- **Component Structure**: Create feature-based component architecture in `src/features/boards/` with reusable board, list, and card components
- **Responsive Design**: Implement mobile-first design using Mantine responsive components and breakpoints for tablet/desktop optimization

### UI/UX Specifications

- **Visual Design**: Follow Mantine design system with consistent colors, typography, and spacing for professional appearance
- **Card Animations**: Smooth drag animations with visual feedback (lift effect, drop zones, placeholders) using CSS transitions
- **Loading States**: Implement skeleton loaders for board/card data and optimistic updates for immediate user feedback
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries with user-friendly error messages and retry mechanisms
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation support, ARIA labels, and screen reader compatibility for drag-and-drop operations

### Performance Optimization

- **Virtual Scrolling**: Implement for boards with 100+ cards using React Window or similar solution
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic compression and lazy loading for card cover images and attachments
- **Bundle Optimization**: Code splitting for board components and lazy loading of rich text editor
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement React Query caching with stale-while-revalidate for board data
- **Debounced Operations**: Batch rapid card movements and auto-save operations to reduce API calls

### Integration Requirements

- **Content Management**: Seamless linking between content items and project cards with bidirectional references
- **User Authentication**: Integration with existing NextAuth.js role-based permissions for board access control
- **File Upload**: Enhanced UploadThing integration for card attachments with progress indicators and file type validation
- **Email Notifications**: Extend existing Resend integration for board activity notifications and @mentions
- **Search Integration**: Extend global search to include board names, card titles, and card content

### Browser Compatibility

- **Modern Browsers**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+ with ES2020 support
- **Mobile Browsers**: iOS Safari 14+, Chrome Mobile 90+, Samsung Internet 13+
- **Touch Support**: Native touch events for mobile drag-and-drop with haptic feedback where available
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript, enhanced features require modern browser support

## External Dependencies

**New libraries required for enhanced functionality:**

- **@hello-pangea/dnd** - Advanced drag-and-drop library for complex board interactions
  - **Justification:** Provides better touch support and accessibility compared to basic @dnd-kit, specifically designed for Trello-like interfaces

- **react-window** - Virtual scrolling for performance optimization
  - **Justification:** Essential for handling large boards with 500+ cards without performance degradation

- **socket.io-client** - Real-time WebSocket communication
  - **Justification:** Robust real-time updates with automatic reconnection and fallback support for collaborative editing

- **react-hotkeys-hook** - Keyboard shortcuts for power users
  - **Justification:** Enables professional keyboard navigation (Ctrl+K for search, shortcuts for card creation) expected in project management tools
