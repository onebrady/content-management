# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Trello-like Project Management System
> Created: 2025-08-06
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Transform the existing basic project management feature into a comprehensive Trello-inspired kanban board system with visual task management, real-time collaboration, and enhanced client project workflows. This will provide independent developers with professional project management capabilities while maintaining simple, intuitive interfaces for client collaboration.

## User Stories

### Visual Project Management

As an independent developer, I want to create visual kanban boards with customizable columns, so that I can organize client projects in a clear, professional way that clients can easily understand and follow.

**Workflow:** Developer creates a new project board, customizes column names (e.g., "Backlog", "In Progress", "Client Review", "Complete"), adds tasks as cards, and drags cards between columns as work progresses. Board provides real-time status updates for both developer and client.

### Real-time Client Collaboration

As a client, I want to see live updates when my developer moves tasks and adds comments, so that I can stay informed about project progress without constantly asking for status updates.

**Workflow:** Client logs into their portal, views project board, sees tasks moving between columns in real-time, receives notifications for important updates, and can add comments or feedback directly on relevant task cards.

### Rich Task Management

As a project collaborator, I want to add detailed information to task cards including checklists, file attachments, due dates, and time estimates, so that all project information is centralized and easily accessible.

**Workflow:** User clicks on a task card to open detailed view, adds description, creates checklist items, uploads relevant files, sets due dates, assigns team members, and tracks time spent. All information is saved automatically and visible to appropriate team members.

## Spec Scope

1. **Visual Kanban Boards** - Full-screen board interface with drag-and-drop task cards between customizable columns
2. **Enhanced Task Cards** - Rich card details with descriptions, checklists, attachments, comments, due dates, and assignments
3. **Real-time Collaboration** - Live updates using WebSocket/SSE when multiple users work on the same board
4. **Board Templates** - Pre-configured board layouts for common workflows (bug tracking, content pipeline, sprint planning)
5. **Team Management** - Board-level permissions, member invitations, and role-based access control
6. **Activity Tracking** - Comprehensive activity feed showing all board and card changes with timestamps and user attribution

## Out of Scope

- Advanced project analytics and reporting (planned for Phase 2)
- Time tracking integration with billing systems (future enhancement)
- Mobile app development (desktop/tablet web interface only)
- Third-party integrations (Slack, GitHub, etc.)
- Advanced automation rules and triggers
- Multi-workspace or enterprise features

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Kanban Interface** - Users can create boards, add/edit columns, create task cards, and drag cards between columns with smooth visual feedback
2. **Real-time Collaboration** - Multiple users can work on the same board simultaneously with live updates appearing immediately for all participants
3. **Complete Task Management** - Task cards support rich details including checklists, file attachments, comments, due dates, and team member assignments with full CRUD operations
