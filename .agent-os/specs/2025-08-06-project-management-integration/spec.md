# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Project Management System Activation
> Created: 2025-08-06
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Activate the new Trello-like project management system as the primary project interface, remove all old column/task-based components and code, and ensure clean integration with existing navigation and user authentication.

## User Stories

### New Project Management Interface

As a user, I want to access the new Trello-like board interface when I click on the Projects navigation link, so that I can create and manage projects with modern collaboration features, real-time updates, and advanced task management capabilities.

The workflow involves navigating to /projects to see a clean project listing, creating new projects that use the new list/card structure, and accessing individual project boards that load with the new BoardView component with real-time collaboration features enabled.

### Clean Codebase Management

As a developer, I want all old project management code removed from the codebase, so that the application is maintainable, has no unused components, and only contains the modern Trello-like system.

The cleanup process will remove old ProjectBoard components, deprecated API endpoints, unused task management code, and any references to the old column/task schema throughout the application.

### Seamless Navigation Integration

As a user, I want the Projects navigation to work seamlessly with the new system, so that I can immediately access the modern project management features without any confusion or broken links.

The navigation system will route to the new board interface, all project-related links will work with the new schema, and the user experience will be consistent throughout the application.

## Spec Scope

1. **System Activation** - Enable the new Trello-like board system as the primary project management interface
2. **Navigation Integration** - Update all navigation links and routes to use the new board components
3. **Old Code Removal** - Remove deprecated ProjectBoard, TaskCard, Column/Task components and related code
4. **API Cleanup** - Remove old API endpoints and ensure new endpoints are properly integrated
5. **Real-time Activation** - Enable WebSocket-based real-time collaboration for all new projects

## Out of Scope

- Data migration from old system (no existing data to preserve)
- Backward compatibility with old column/task system
- Creating new project management features beyond what's already implemented
- Modifying existing authentication or user management systems

## Expected Deliverable

1. The /projects navigation link takes users to a clean project listing using the new schema
2. New projects can be created and managed using the Trello-like board interface with real-time collaboration
3. All old project management code is removed and the codebase is clean and maintainable
