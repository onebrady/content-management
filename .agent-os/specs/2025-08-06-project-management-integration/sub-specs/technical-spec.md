# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-06-project-management-integration/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### System Activation Strategy

- **Component Integration**: Replace old ProjectBoard with new BoardView component in all routes
- **API Activation**: Enable new board API endpoints and remove deprecated column/task endpoints
- **Schema Utilization**: Ensure all new projects use ProjectList/ProjectCard models exclusively
- **Real-time Features**: Activate WebSocket collaboration for all project board interactions
- **Navigation Updates**: Update all project-related navigation to use new board interface
- **Code Cleanup**: Remove all unused old project management components and utilities

### Component Integration Architecture

- **Route Replacement**: Update `/projects/[id]` to render new BoardView instead of old ProjectBoard
- **Navigation Updates**: Modify navigation configuration to use new board components
- **Component Removal**: Remove old ProjectBoard, TaskCard, Column/Task components and related files
- **Project Listing**: Update projects page to work with new schema and show list/card counts
- **Error Boundaries**: Ensure proper error handling for new board interface

### Real-time Collaboration Activation

- **WebSocket Integration**: Enable Socket.IO real-time features for all project boards
- **User Presence**: Activate live user presence indicators for collaborative editing
- **Conflict Resolution**: Enable smart conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
- **Connection Management**: Ensure stable WebSocket connections for project board pages
- **Performance Optimization**: Implement efficient event broadcasting for project teams

### API Endpoint Updates

- **New API Integration**: Ensure board API endpoints (/api/projects/[id]/board) are active
- **Response Format**: Projects API returns new list/card data structure
- **Old Endpoint Removal**: Remove deprecated column/task API endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Proper error responses for board-related operations
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize queries for nested list/card relationships

### Code Cleanup and Removal

- **Component Cleanup**: Remove unused ProjectBoard, TaskCard, and legacy task components
- **API Cleanup**: Remove old column/task API routes and controllers
- **Hook Cleanup**: Remove old project data hooks that use column/task schema
- **Type Cleanup**: Remove old TypeScript types for Column/Task models
- **Test Cleanup**: Remove or update tests for removed components and APIs

### UI/UX Consistency

- **Visual Continuity**: Ensure new board interface maintains familiar project management patterns
- **Responsive Design**: Guarantee mobile and tablet compatibility for new board system
- **Accessibility**: Maintain WCAG compliance throughout the new interface
- **Loading States**: Implement proper loading indicators during migration and data fetching
- **Theme Integration**: Ensure new components work with existing Mantine theme system

### Performance Requirements

- **Load Time**: Project boards must load within 2 seconds for projects with up to 100 cards
- **Real-time Latency**: WebSocket events must propagate to connected users within 200ms
- **Database Efficiency**: Migration must complete for 100 projects within 30 seconds
- **Memory Usage**: Board interface must operate efficiently with minimal memory footprint
- **Scalability**: Support for projects with up to 500 cards and 50 simultaneous collaborators

## External Dependencies

No new external dependencies are required for this integration. All necessary libraries (Socket.IO, @hello-pangea/dnd, Mantine components) are already installed and implemented in the new Trello-like system.
