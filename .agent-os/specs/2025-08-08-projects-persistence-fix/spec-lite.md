# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement authoritative server-side ordering for `/projects` card moves and adjust client DnD to send destination intent (status + index). Ensure moves persist across reloads without extra interaction and remove lingering drop-shadow artifacts. Add tests (unit/integration/E2E) and keep backward compatibility.
