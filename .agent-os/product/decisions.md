## 2025-01-06: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner (Independent Developer), Target Clients

### Decision

ClientFlow will be a client business management platform combining content management, Trello-like project boards, and business intelligence dashboards. Primary focus on independent developers managing client projects with transparent collaboration and automated KPI tracking.

### Context

Independent developers need a professional platform to manage client relationships while providing transparency and collaboration capabilities. Current market solutions are either too complex for small teams or lack the business intelligence features clients need. There's a clear opportunity to serve the growing independent developer market with a tool that bridges technical project management and client business needs.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Generic Project Management Tool (Trello/Asana)**
   - Pros: Established market, proven UI patterns
   - Cons: Not optimized for client collaboration, lacks business intelligence

2. **Custom Client Portals + Separate PM Tools**
   - Pros: Best-of-breed solutions for each need
   - Cons: Fragmented experience, higher maintenance, poor integration

3. **Enterprise Project Management (Jira/Monday)**
   - Pros: Comprehensive features, scalable
   - Cons: Too complex for target market, expensive, developer-focused

### Rationale

The decision is based on market gap identification: independent developers need professional tools that serve both their technical needs and their clients' business requirements. The dual-dashboard approach provides value to both user types while maintaining simplicity. The existing content management foundation provides a strong base for expansion.

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Clear market differentiation with dual-perspective design
- Leverages existing content management system as foundation
- Addresses real pain points for underserved market segment
- Scalable architecture allows growth with client base

**Negative:**

- Need to balance complexity between developer and client needs
- Requires ongoing user research for both user types
- May need to resist feature creep to maintain simplicity

## 2025-01-06: Technology Stack Consolidation

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Developer, Future Team Members

### Decision

Continue with current tech stack: Next.js 15, Mantine UI, PostgreSQL/Neon, and complete migration from Material-UI to Mantine. Focus on simplicity and avoid adding new major dependencies unless absolutely necessary.

### Context

The codebase has evolved from Material-UI to Mantine, providing better developer experience and performance. The current stack is modern, maintainable, and suitable for the target scale. Adding complexity should be avoided to maintain development velocity.

### Rationale

- Mantine provides better TypeScript support and developer experience
- Current stack handles target scale efficiently
- Consistency reduces maintenance burden
- Simplicity enables faster feature development

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Improved development velocity with consistent patterns
- Better performance and bundle size with Mantine
- Easier onboarding for future team members
- Reduced technical debt

**Negative:**

- Some learning curve for Mantine-specific patterns
- May need custom components for unique requirements

## 2025-01-06: Database and Performance Strategy

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Developer, Future Clients

### Decision

Use PostgreSQL with Neon for managed hosting, implement proper connection pooling, and design for horizontal scaling from the start. Prioritize preventing breaking changes in production through careful migration planning.

### Context

Database performance and reliability are critical for client-facing applications. Neon provides excellent PostgreSQL hosting with automatic scaling, but requires careful connection management for serverless deployments.

### Rationale

- PostgreSQL provides rich data types and relationships needed for complex project management
- Neon offers automatic scaling and excellent developer experience
- Proper connection pooling prevents serverless cold start issues
- Careful migration planning prevents production downtime

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Reliable, scalable database infrastructure
- Excellent local development experience with Docker
- Automatic backups and point-in-time recovery
- No vendor lock-in with standard PostgreSQL

**Negative:**

- Need to carefully manage connection pooling in serverless environment
- Migration planning requires extra attention to prevent breaking changes

## 2025-01-06: Development and Deployment Philosophy

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Process
**Stakeholders:** Developer, Clients

### Decision

Prioritize simplicity over complexity in all implementations, use feature flags for gradual rollouts, and maintain comprehensive testing to prevent production issues. Focus on best practices that enable sustainable growth.

### Context

As an independent developer serving multiple clients, code quality and reliability are essential. Breaking changes in production can damage client relationships and business reputation.

### Rationale

- Simplicity reduces bugs and maintenance overhead
- Feature flags allow safe deployment of new features
- Comprehensive testing catches issues before production
- Best practices enable scaling the development team in the future

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Higher code quality and fewer production issues
- Ability to iterate quickly with confidence
- Professional client experience with reliable platform
- Easier to onboard future team members

**Negative:**

- Some additional overhead for testing and feature flag management
- May take longer to implement complex features initially
